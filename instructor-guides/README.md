# Instructor Guides for Nomad Workshops
Instructor Guides for all Nomad workshops should be created as Markdown files and placed in this directory. They should have names like `<cloud>_<workshop_name>_INSTRUCTOR_GUIDE.md` where `<cloud>` is the cloud the workshop targets and `<workshop_name>` is the name of the workshop. But if the workshop is intended for use with multiple clouds, `<cloud>` should be omitted.

Please do not use sub-directories for instructor guides.
