  title: Verify the Health of Your Nomad Enterprise Cluster
  teaser: |
    Verify the health of the Nomad Enterprise cluster that has been deployed for you by the track's setup scripts.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge, you will verify the health of the Nomad Enterprise cluster that has been deployed for you by the track's setup scripts. This will include checking the health of a Consul cluster that has been set up on the same VMs.

    The cluster is running 1 Nomad/Consul server and 3 Nomad/Consul clients.

    First, verify that all 4 Consul agents are running and connected to the cluster by running this command on the "Server" tab:
    ```
    consul members
    ```
    You should see 4 Consul agents.

    Check that the Nomad server is running by running this command on the "Server" tab:
    ```
    nomad server members
    ```
    You should see 1 Nomad server.

    Check the status of the Nomad client nodes by running this command on the "Server" tab:
    ```
    nomad node status
    ```
    You should see 3 Nomad clients.

    Please also run the last command on the "Client 1", "Client 2", and "Client 3" tabs. In each case, you should see the same 3 Nomad clients.

    In the next challenge, you will configure Nomad Enterprise namespaces.
