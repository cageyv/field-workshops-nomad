# Nomad Jobs
* We've already discussed **Nomad Jobs** in Chapter 2 and have already run a simple job in our first lab.
* But what exactly is a Nomad Job?
  * A specification provided by a user that declares  a workload for Nomad.
  * A form of **desired state** for that workload.
  * The actual workload executed by the job.
* Nomad decides where the job should run and makes sure that the **actual state** matches the user's desired state.
* Jobs are composed of one or more task groups which contain tasks.

???
* Define Jobs again to make sure we're all on the same page.

name: Job Types and Schedulers
class: col-2, smaller
# Nomad Job Types and Schedulers
- The [type stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/job.html#type) specifies the Nomad scheduler to use.
 - Nomad has three scheduler types that can be used when creating your job:
  - `service`
  - `system`
  - `batch`

<br>

```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
* type = "system"
}
```
???
* There are 3 types of Nomad jobs, corresponding to the three types of Nomad schedulers

---
name: Service Scheduler
# Service Scheduler
- The [Service Scheduler](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers.html#service) is designed for scheduling long lived services that should never go down
- Service jobs are intended to run until explicitly stopped by an operator.
- If a service task exits it is considered a failure and handled according to the job's `restart` and `reschedule` stanzas.

???
* First, we have the Service Scheduler

---
name: Batch Scheduler
# Batch Scheduler
  - The [Batch Scheduler](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers.html#batch) runs batch jobs, which are short lived, usually finishing in a few minutes to a few days.
  - They are much less sensitive to short term performance fluctuations.
  - Batch jobs are intended to run until they exit successfully.
  - Batch tasks that exit with an error are handled according to the job's `restart` and `reschedule` stanzas.

???
* Then, we have the Batch Scheduler

---
name: System Scheduler
class: smaller
# System Scheduler
- The [System Scheduler](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/schedulers.html#system) registers jobs that should run on all clients that meet constraints.
- It is also invoked when clients join the cluster or transition into the ready state.
  - This means that all registered system jobs will be re-evaluated and their tasks will be placed on the newly available nodes if the constraints are met.
- Systems jobs are intended to run until explicitly stopped either by an operator or by preemption.
- If a system task exits it is considered a failure and handled according to the job's `restart` stanza.
- System jobs do not have rescheduling.

???
* And last we have the System Scheduler.

# Declaring Jobs and Their Target Datacenters

.smaller[
- [Nomad Jobs](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification) are the primary configuration that users interact with when using Nomad.
- Nomad models infrastructure as regions and datacenters.
- Regions may contain multiple datacenters.
- Servers are assigned to a specific region, managing state and making scheduling decisions within that region.
]

```hcl

*job "example" {
* datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
      }
    }
  }
}
```

???

---
name: Declaring Task Groups
class: compact, col-2
# Declaring Task Groups

.smaller[
- The [group stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/group.html) defines a series of tasks that should be co-located on the same Nomad client.
- Any task within a group will be placed on the same client.
- But note that multiple instances of a task group can be placed.
]
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
*  group "cache" {
*    task "redis" {
*     driver = "docker"
*    }
*    task "web" {
*     driver = "docker"

name: Declaring Tasks
class: compact, col-2
# Declaring Tasks
.smaller[
- The [task stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/task.html) creates an individual unit of work, such as a Docker container, web application, or batch processing.
- Tasks can be short-lived batch jobs or long-running services such as a web application, database server, or API.
]
<br>
```hcl
job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
   group "cache" {
*    task "redis" {
*      driver = "docker"
*      config {
*      }
*    }

name: Declaring Task Drivers
class: compact, col-2
# Declaring Task Drivers
.smaller[
-   [Task Drivers](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/drivers) are used by Nomad clients to execute a task and provide resource isolation.
    -  Task driver resource isolation is intended to provide separation of Nomad client CPU, memory, and storage between tasks.
    -  Resource isolation effectiveness is dependent upon individual task driver implementations and underlying operating systems.
]
<br>
```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
   group "cache" {
     task "redis" {
*     driver = "docker"
     }
     task "web" {

name: Specifying Required Resources
class: compact, col-2
# Specifying Required Resources
- The [resources stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/resources.html) describes the requirements a task requires.
  - Resource requirements include memory, network, CPU, and device.
  - Tasks will only be scheduled to client nodes that satisfy its resource requirements.

<br>
```hcl

job "example" {
  group "cache"
  {
    task "redis" {
*     resources {
*       cpu    = 500
*       memory = 256
*       network {
*         mbits = 100
*         port  "db"  {}
*       }
*     }
    }
  }

name: Specifying Networking
class: compact, col-2
# Specifying Networking
- The [network stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html) specifies the networking requirements for the task.
  - Bandwidth
  - Port Allocations

<br>
<br>
<br>

```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"
      resources {
        cpu    = 500
        memory = 256
*       network {
*         mbits = 100
*         port  "db"  {}
*       }
      }
    }
```

# Specifying Port Mapping
.smaller[
- Nomad supports [Dynamic Ports](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#dynamic-ports), [Static Ports](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#static-ports), and [Mapped Ports](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#mapped-ports).

* In this example, Redis is listening on port 6379 inside the Docker container.
* Nomad will dynamically select a port and map requests sent to it to port 6379 inside the container.
]

<br>
<br>
<br>

```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"
      config {
*       port_map = {
*         db = 6379
*       }
      }

name: Specifying Bridged Networks

# Specifying Bridged Networks
.smaller[
-  When the network stanza is defined at the group level with [bridge](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/network.html#bridge-mode) as the networking mode, all tasks in the task group share the same network namespace.
-  Tasks running within a network namespace are not visible to applications outside the namespace on the same host.
]

<br>
<br>
<br>

```hcl

job "example" {
  datacenters = ["dc1"]
  group "cache" {
    task "redis" {
      driver = "docker"
    }
    network {
*     mode = "bridge"
*       port "http" {
*         static = 9002
*         to     = 9002
*       }
*     }
    }
  }
```

name: Registering Tasks as Consul Services
class: compact, col-2
# Registering Tasks as Consul Services
.smaller[
- The [service stanza](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service.html) instructs Nomad to register the service with Consul for Service Discovery.
- We can define tags, health checks, ports, and several other [parameters](https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/job-specification/service.html#service-parameters).

*         check {
*           type     = "tcp"
*           port     = "db"
