# Nomad Server
A Nomad **Server** is a machine that runs the Nomad agent in a region that manages all jobs and clients, run evaluations, and create task allocations.
```config
server {
  enabled          = true
  bootstrap_expect = 3
  server_join {
    retry_join = ["<nomad-server-address>"]
  }
}
```
`enabled` = specifies if this agent should run in server mode<br>
`bootstrap_expect`= specifies the number of server nodes to wait for<br>

name: nomad-client-config
class: compact
# Nomad Client
A Nomad **Client** is a machine that runs the Nomad agent where tasks can be run on. The agent is responsible for registering with the servers, watching for any work to be assigned and executing tasks

```config
client {
  enabled = true
  servers = ["<nomad-server-address>"]
}
```
`enabled` = specifies if client mode is enabled<br>
`servers` = array of addresses of Nomad servers this client should joins

# Important Nomad Commands
- Run a single Nomad agent in development mode <br>
    `sudo nomad agent -dev`
- Check your version of Nomad <br>
    `nomad version`
- Check the Nomad server(s) status <br>
    `nomad server members`
- Check the Nomad node(s) status <br>
    `nomad node status`
- Enable drain mode on the local node <br>
    `nomad node drain -enable -self`

# üë©‚Äçüíª Lab Challenge 4.1: Deploy a Simple Nomad Cluster

In this lab you'll learn how to deploy a simple Nomad cluster, configure both server and client agents, perform node discovery and perform the cluster operations to verify everything is working.

Follow the Instruqt Track URL:
https://instruqt.com/hashicorp/tracks/nomad-simple-cluster

üõë **STOP** after you complete the 1st challenge.

# Simple Cluster Recap
In this section, we:
- Defined the components of a Nomad Cluster
- Reviewed the configuration of a Server agent
- Reviewed the configuration of a Client agent
- Learned the basics of a Nomad Client/Server Architecture
- Ran simple Nomad Cluster commands to verify the cluster's health

name: job-specification
# Nomad Job Specification
- The job specification (jobspec) defines the deployment schema for the application
- Includes the `tasks`, `images`, `resources`, `priorities`, `constraints`, `service` registrations, `secrets` and other information required to deploy the application
- Specified in the Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)

# Anatomy of a Job File

- **Job**
    - Declarative specification of tasks that Nomad should run
- **Group**
    - Series of tasks that should be co-located on the same Nomad client
- **Tasks**
    - An individual unit of work, such as a Docker container, web application, or batch processing

# Job Specification Hierarchy

- Each job file can only a single job that may contain multiple groups
- In each group, you can define multiple tasks

```jobspec
job "example" {
    ...
    group "db" {
        ...
        task "postgres" { ... }
        task "mysql" { ... }
    }
    group "web" {
        task "tomcat" { driver = "docker" }
    }
}
```

# Running a Job
To generate a sample job file, run:

```nomadcmd
*nomad job init -short
 Example job file written to example.nomad
```
In this example job file, we have declared a single task 'redis' which is using the Docker driver to run the task. To run the job and deploy this task:
```nomadcmd
*nomad job run example.nomad
 ==> Monitoring evaluation "13ebb66d"
     Evaluation triggered by job "example"
    ...
```

# Inspect a Running Job

To inspect the status of the job `example` we just deployed, simply run: <br>
```nomadcmd
*nomad status example
 ID            = example
 Name          = example
 Submit Date   = 12/30/19 07:50:31 UTC
 Type          = service
 ...
Allocations
ID        Node ID   Task Group  Version  Desired  Status   Created  Modified
*4ef94ade  234c769f  cache       0        run      running  2m ago   2m ago
```
Take note of the ***Allocation ID***, we'll need it for reference later.

name: inspect-allocation-job
class: compact
# Inspect Task Allocation
To review a task allocation on a the running node: <br>
`nomad alloc status <allocation id>` <br>
```nomadcmd
*nomad alloc status 4ef94ade
*ID                  = 4ef94ade
Eval ID             = 13ebb66d
Name                = example.cache[0]
*Node ID             = 234c769f
Job ID              = example
...
```
We'll use the ***Allocation ID*** from the status output to retrieve the state of the allocation and its current usage.
