# Introductions

* Your Name
* Job Title
* Secrets Management Experience
* Favorite Text Editor

???
* Use this slide to introduce yourself, give a little bit of your background story, then go around the room and have all your participants introduce themselves.

* The favorite text editor question is a good ice breaker, but perhaps more importantly it gives you an immediate gauge of how technical your users are.
