# Nomad's Business Value
.center[![:scale 70%](images/Nomad_Business_Value.png)]

???
-  Lowers total cost of ownership (TCO) via bin packing
-  Runs both containerized and legacy apps (e.g. Java classes and jars)
-  Easy to operate and maintain

# What is Nomad
.smaller[
* A flexible, lightweight, high performing, easy to use orchestrator
* Used to deploy and manage containers and legacy applications simultaneously
* Works across data centers and cloud platforms, providing universal scheduling
* Manages services, batch functions, as well as global system services
]

???
- Runs as a single binary in just about any environment - one of the easiest and lightweight service scheduler and manager available.
-  Used to deploy both container applications, as well as legacy applications such as Java or raw executables.
-  As an independent function, Nomad can run and communicate across data centers, and cloud platforms.  Truly cloud agnostic.
-  Can manage individual services, batch functions, or even global system services such as monitoring functions.

# Nomad Enterprise Features
.smaller[
* All Open Source Features
* Automated Upgrades
* Enhanced Read Scalability
* Redundancy Zones
* Namespaces
* Resource Quotas
* Preemption
* Sentinel Policies
]

???
- All Open Source Features are included in Enterprise
- Autopilot Upgrades
- Servers can act as a non-voting member of the cluster to help provide read scalability
- Nomad attempts to parition servers according to specified redundancy zone, and will aim to keep one voting server per zone
- Segregate workloads using Namespaces
- Quotas limit resource consumption across teams or projects to reduce waste and align budgets
- A shared cluster can be partitioned into multiple namespaces which allow jobs and their associated objects to be isolated from each other and other users of the cluster
- Preemption enables Nomad's scheduler to automatically evict lower priority allocations of service and batch jobs so that allocations from higher priority jobs can be placed. 
- Sentinel defines policies such as disallowing jobs to be submitted to production on Fridays or only allowing users to run jobs that use pre-authorized Docker images
