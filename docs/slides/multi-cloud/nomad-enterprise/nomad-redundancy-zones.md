# Nomad Redundancy Zones

* Without Redundancy Zones
    * Server Cluster in each Availability Zone (3-5 machines per zone)
    * Or give up redundancy with a single Server in each Zone
* With Redundancy Zones
    * Servers are associated with Availability Zones
    * Nomad keeps one voting server in each Zone
    * Cluster Functionality retained across Availabity Zone Failures

???
- Redundancy Zones allows servers to be associated with a zone, and enables clusters to communicate across zones
- Without Redundancy Zones, each Zone would have an independent cluster, or just forego server redundancy
- Using Nomad Autopilot with Redundancy Zones ensures cluster operation continuity in the event of zone failures
