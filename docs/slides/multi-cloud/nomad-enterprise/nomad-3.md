name: Nomad Enterprise Features - Autopilot
# Nomad Enterprise - Autopilot

* Autopilot is a function that enables multiple features
    * Automated Upgrades/Upgrade Migration
    * Enhanced Read Scalability
    * Redundancy Across Availability Zones

???
- Autopilot enables multiple features within Nomad Enterprise.
- This section focuses on Automated Upgrades, Read Scalability, and Redundancy Zones

---
name: Automated Upgrade Overview
# Upgrade Process

* Add New Servers to Cluster with Updated Versions
* Autopilot won't promote new Servers until Quorum Achived
* Once Quorum Achived, Autopilot pomotes new Servers, demotes old servers
* Autopilot can remove old servers from cluster automatically
* Upgrade complete!

???
- This section discusses Nomad's ability to automatically upgrade an entire cluster of Nomad servers in an automatic and controlled fashion.
- Sometimes be referred to as "upgrade migration"
- Starting with a basic cluster, all on the same version

???
- Once enough new servers are introduced, quorum achieved
- Nomad automatically demotes old servers
- Note:  This is default operation and can be overridden

- Once the new servers have been promoted old servers can be decommissioned

name: Scaling Readbility
# Increasing Read Scalability

* Add Non-Voting Servers to Cluster
* Receives Replicated Data, But Never Promoted
* Improves Scheduling Abilities and Read Performance
* Configured in server Stanza with `non_voting_server` Parameter

---
name: Nomad Redundancy Zones
# Nomad Redundancy Zones

* Without Redundancy Zones
    * Server Cluster in each Availability Zone (3-5 machines per zone)
    * Or give up redundancy with a single Server in each Zone
* With Redundancy Zones
    * Servers are associated with Availability Zones
    * Nomad keeps one voting server in each Zone
    * Cluster Functionality retained across Availabity Zone Failures

???
- Redundancy Zones allows servers to be associated with a zone, and enables clusters to communicate across zones
- Without Redundancy Zones, each Zone would have an independent cluster, or just forego server redundancy
- Using Nomad Autopilot with Redundancy Zones ensures cluster operation continuity in the event of zone failures
