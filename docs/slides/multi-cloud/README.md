# Slides for Nomad Workshops that Target Multiple Clouds
Slides for all Nomad workshops that target multiple clouds should be created using [Remark](https://remarkjs.com) and placed under this directory.

If your slides only target a single cloud, please put its slides under the [aws](../aws), [azure](../azure), or [gcp](../gcp) directories.

Please be sure to always put all slides for any workshop in its own directory.
